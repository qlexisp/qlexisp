# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alexis

I'm excited to share that I've recently expanded my skill set by learning React and I'm now diving into NodeJS. This progression allows me to craft more dynamic and interactive web applications while enhancing my backend development knowledge.

My journey at BeCode as a Junior Web Developer has already equipped me with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, Sass, Tailwind, JavaScript, and GIT. Now, with the addition of React and NodeJS to my toolkit, I'm even better prepared to tackle technical challenges and make significant contributions to any project.

I am convinced that my diverse background, combined with my ongoing training, makes me an ideal candidate to contribute significantly to your team. Passionate, curious, and determined, I am ready to take on new challenges and add value to any project I participate in. Feel free to contact me through e-mail (in bio) to discuss future collaborations or internship opportunities.
